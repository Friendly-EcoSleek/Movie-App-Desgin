The cat and mouse chase between the two runs the plot of the movie.", "Vikram Aditya (Nagarjuna), a quadriplegic millionaire, appoints Seenu (Karthi) as his caretaker because he’s impressed by the latter’s carefree, indifferent attitude and lack of sympathy towards him. What forms is an unexplainable bond.", "Sivudu (Prabhas) is consumed by a desire to scale the waterfall by the edge of his hamlet right from his childhood, much to the chagrin of his doting mother. One fine day, he ascends the summit only to find out that it he is the son of Amarendra Bahubali, the crown prince of the kingdom of Mahishmati, who gets murdered by his first cousin, Bhalladeva (Rana)."]
    let movieReview : [String] = ["To call Jersey just the story of an ex-cricketer Arjun (Nani) who fights conventions to get selected in the Indian cricket team is a grave injustice to the film, even if that’s how it sums itself up. It is also the story of the love of his life Sarah (Shraddha Srinath), who struggles to stay in love with the man he has become. It’s the story of assistant coach Murthy (Sathyaraj) who sticks by an orphan through thick and thin, even at his most irrational best, in hope that he will be able to aid him in achieving his dream someday. But, most importantly, it’s the story of a father who’s so enamoured with his son Nani (Ronit Kamra) that he would do anything to not stoop low in his eyes and get him the birthday gift he always wanted.                     Despite the multiple threads and three different time frames that connect to Arjun, Gowtam Tinnanuri does a stupendous job of not tangling them all up into a mess. Arjun is an ex-Ranji player, the best right hand batsman of his time and a cocky man who’s unfortunately soon grounded by reality. Sarah is the love of his life who marries him against her father’s wishes and now struggles to stay in love with the shell he is. The once in love couple now constantly seem at warring ends, but the ray of brightness in their life is their son Nani (Ronit Kamra), whose brings in a refreshing innocence to an otherwise hefty story. And then there’s assistant coach Murthy who pushes Arjun to maximise his potential, even when the latter refuses to.               Jersey is a beautifully told tale which sees Nani delivering his career’s best performance with ease. If he’s good as the cocky batsman who knows he’s talented, he’s doubly good as the man who’s constantly beaten by life but refuses to give up. The actor trained and practiced cricket while shooting for the film and it shows in the scenes in which he picks up cricketers’ body language with ease. A while into the film, Nani simply ceases to exist and it is only cricketer Arjun you see, someone who’s as comfortable on the field as he is on the couch in his living room. The realisation of how well he performed especially comes through in key scenes which require him to emote without speaking a word.               While Gowtam Tinnanuri really takes the cake in this one, with his stupendous screenplay and narration, Sanu Varghese’s cinematography and Anirudh Ravichander’s music do their bit to simply pour life into the film. Naveen Nooli too does a good job with the editing, with the film, despite its long runtime and laggy bits, not ending up seeming like a cricket documentary.                   Watch this one this weekend if you’re an ardent fan of cricket, for you will sit on the edge of your seat during the sporting scenes. Watch this one for Nani and the rest of the cast, who will make you fall in love with their characters by the time the end credits roll. But especially watch this one for Gowtam Tinnanuri, for it’s not every day that a director manages to pull off a sports drama like this with ease. Jersey will make you laugh, cry and cheer out loud.", "The film opens with a young Siddharth Abhimanyu (who grows up to be Arvind Swamy) who goes to jail for a crime he didn’t commit, so that his father (Posani) could get an MLA ticket in return. Cut to the present when Dhruva (Ram Charan) an IPS trainee, is introduced as a do-gooder despite bending a few rules with his friends to solve petty crimes. Dhruva lives by the philosophy that “your enemy decides your capacity” and he aims to choose an enemy who has the power to control “a 100 criminals”. Siddharth Abhimanyu, who is now a scientist, a Padma Shri awardee, son of the health minister, a kingmaker and the brain behind several crimes, turns into Dhruva’s target as a result. Thus begins the battle of wits between the two geniuses.                                                                                                                                                                              To begin with, the movie is visually incredible. This includes the actors, the cinematography, the locations and the artwork that went into each and every scene. Ram Charan looks his fittest best. As an actor Ram Charan impresses in all the scenes that required high emotion. The scene where he proposes to Ishika (Rakul Preet Singh) without letting Siddharth Abhimanyu who has him bugged know, would have you fall in love with Dhruva. And as for the scenes where he had to be elevated as the hero, they will not disappoint his fans. Rakul stayed true to the role given to her and delivered. Arvind Swamy though stole the show. You will find yourself waiting for him to appear on screen through the film. His entry in the film – appearing from the smoke as he walks out of his glass laboratory – is perhaps just as much grandiose as that of a star hero. That sums up how important he is to the film.                                                                                                                                                                  Dhruva, as promised, kept the essence of the original, Thani Oruvan, intact. And very well so. The minor changes in the script only added to the drama. The little details added in the hero’s personality, including the uber-fit body and the pen-clicking habit of his, added depth to Dhruva’s character. The final showdown between Dhruva and Siddhartha is what you should be looking forward to. More for watching Arvind Swamy than the climax. Before you know it you will love to hate Siddharth Abhimanyu and Arvind does it oh-so-effortlessly.                                                                                                                                                                                   While the album has already claimed the attention of the Telugu audiences, the BGM in the film elevates the experience of the film to the next level. The sounds used are fresh and add to the punch that the movie packs.                                                                                                                   One disappointment would be the dialogues that are weak and redundant, much like those of English movies dubbed in Telugu. And if you are the one to nitpick, then you will find the end of a powerful character like Siddharth Abhimanyu rather weak. You’d expect something on the lines of Neelambari’s death from Narasimha, but this one misses that impact – mostly because of the words it was put in than because of the actor or the script itself. However, Dhruva promises to be an edge-of-the-seat entertainer and it delivers impeccably. You won’t find yourself looking away from the screen through the two-hour-forty-minute runtime. Go watch it.", "In general, remakes are a tough bet. More so, when the film is a French classic like The Intouchables and is being remade for a regional audience in a foreign land like India which is completely different in terms of the culture and sensibilities. And that’s how Oopiri comes across as a ‘breath’ of fresh air because along with managing to stay true to the original (in every aspect), this film also stands on its own and lives up to its tagline ‘celebration of life’.                                                                                                                                                                   For Oopiri is the story of bonding between two unconventional men – Vikram Aditya (Nagarjuna) and Seenu (Karthi) – whose paths meet on their journey of life. Vikram is a millionaire whose life has paused after a grave accident that incapacitated his body from below the neck and unknowingly is in search of true meaning of existence. Seenu is a petty criminal and a happy young man who shares a rather strained relationship with his family and all he wants from life is money to get rid of all troubles.                                                                                                                                We are taken into the lives of these two men and their different worlds and in the midst of it all, we experience how they make each other’s life so different that there comes a point we wonder if they’d be as happy with each other. The parallel transition of their characters – Seenu slowly grows into a responsible individual who learns the way to mend his relationship with the family and Vikram achieves an emotional closure in everything related to his life and is ready to start afresh – is the most wonderfully weaved in element of the film and we cry and laugh with the protagonists as they go through these multitudinous emotions which are brilliantly enhanced by Gopi Sundar’s riveting music.                                                                                                          Karthi is the cynosure of all eyes and steals the show right from the start with his ability to bring to life every single moment. And, he is ably supported by Nagarjuna who makes the disability seem extremely real. Tamannaah isn’t just eye candy and has given her career best performance in this film which sees her dubbing for herself (a great decision definitely). Jaya Sudha proves why she holds the ‘sahaja nati’ tag and Kalpana’s last act is worth remembering. Prakash Raj and Ali have significant roles. Anushka and Shriya leave an impression with their cameos.                                                                    But then, there are some moments in the film that come across as absolutely unnecessary and dragged out making you wonder if the film would have been a lot better otherwise. One such instance would be the car racing sequence which, though key to the film’s plot, is an absolute drag and diverts your concentration. Add to that are a couple of songs, one being the romantic track between Karthi and Tamannaah seem an absolute waste. The film is pretty racy in the first half but it is the second half where we are left looking at the watch quite a few times. However, you set the flaws aside, and get a brilliant climax with 30 minutes of engrossing moments.                                                                                                           To lay it on the line, Oopiri is a beautiful film. It doesn’t really aim to give a message but ends up giving you an important lesson. It takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and tells you that nothing can stop you from living life the way you want to because you only live once and make it count. Learn the art of celebration of life, it will make it worth living.                                                                                              From ensuring the soul is intact to successfully recreating a story for a completely different set of audiences, Oopiri sets a benchmark for adaptations in Telugu cinema and paves the way for more exciting genres. Director Vamshi Paidipally makes a difficult task seem easier than reading out ABC! And, he does that by bringing together two leading mainstream actors from different film industries. Can it get any better?", "To cut a long story short, this “magnum opus” is a CGI laden attempt to blend the good old folk lore format into a kitschy hero-worshipping Tollywood potboiler. A romantic sequence in which Sivudu woos Avanthika (Tamannaah) emphatically proves why. A brief background about Avanthika first: a feared warrior from the fiefdom of Kuntala, she’s dedicated her life to the cause of rescuing Devasena (Anushka), the wife of Amarendra Bahubali and mother of Sivudu, from the clutches of the vicious Bhallaladeva, the backbiting first cousin of Bahubali who usurps the throne. Cut to the scene. “Nuvvu oka aada pillavi.                                                                                                                     Nenu oka mogadini. Nenu aa neeti konda ni ekki vachcha nini premisthuna ani cheppadaniki, (You are a girl, I'm a man, who has climbed up this mountain, to say I love you), quips Prabhas, even as Avanthika has her sword pointed at his heart. For the next couple of minutes, a fight ensues during the course of which he skillfully disrobes her right down to her (very fashionable) red inner wear, and leaves a splattering of his blood on her forehead. seeing her own reflection in a sheath of water cascading from a cliff, Tamannah realises that he is her man and jumps to embrace him. Then they make love over a song. It turns out Sivudu is the son of the very Devasena that Avanthika — never mind the flip flop in her character sketch — has avowed to die trying to rescue. From then on, Prabhas takes over as he sets out fulfil his destiny of avenging his father’s death. The whole of first half seems like a little over an hour-and-a-half-long prelude for the flashback episode that goes back 50 years in time. Infants, Bhallaladeva and Bahubali are both heirs to the throne of Mahishmathi, when the then king dies an untimely death.                                                                                               The queen Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) ascends to the throne and decrees that the worthier of the two cousins will be crowned king. Bhallaladeva, being the son of the younger brother (Nasser) of the deceased king, who was denied the throne owing to serious character flaws, inherits his father’s desire to become the emperor. The best part of the film is the elaborate war sequence that plays out in the second half. The ostentatious sets, breathtaking montage shots of the fictional kingdom, and the sheer scale of the battle scene stand out. The inspiration from Hollywood epics like 300, Troy, Lord of the Rings, Conan the Barbarian, Pirates of the Caribbean, Croods, Prince of Persia (to name a few) are all too evident in the battle sequences. Yet, it is still a first for Tollywood and perhaps even Indian cinema, even though the end result may be a little too underwhelming.                                                                                                                                                                    Let’s just say how much the CGI will move you will depend on how much you empathise with the fact that a filmmaker has attempted it. In any case Rajamouli isn’t known as much for originality as he is for delivering an overwhelming cinematic experience. But we’re afraid there’s plenty that has gone wrong on that score too. There’s got to be something wrong when the highest point in what is Telugu cinema’s greatest war sequence is a minute-long monologue delivered by Prabhas, who sounds a little too shrill for his rippling muscles. Rana’s decibel levels might have overshadowed Prabhas’, to sum up the performances which are a little too high on theatrics and low on chutzpah. The music by Keeravani is the biggest dampener of them all. The most redeeming part of the film must be the bare body shots of Rana and Prabhas. The fans and the ladies must dig it."]
